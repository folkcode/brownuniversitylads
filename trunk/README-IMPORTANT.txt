There are 2 important sets of data in "GCNAv/bin/Debug/": "data-full" and "data empty", we'll be switching between the two constantly. The set of data currently being used is named "data".

Follow this or terrible things will happen.

"data-full" (or "data", if "data-full" doesn't exist) contains the demo data set. Make sure to change this folder name to "data" before any demo, and name the other set of data properly.

"data-empty" (or "data", if "data-empty" doesn't exist) is the data folder in the lads repository. Make sure to change this folder name to "data" before any svn operation, and name the other set of data properly.
