This is the open-source release of LADS, a Brown University run, Microsoft Research sponsored project designed to enable museums to display collections of large or fragile pieces digitally. LADS enables a curator to tag artworks with location-specific data as hotspots, as well as associate related assets to an artwork (such as a newspaper article mentioning the piece). Users can browse the collection, delve deeply into individual artworks, and collect assets related to their interests in their personal workspace.
